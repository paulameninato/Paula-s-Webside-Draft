        <p>I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I had an unusual childhood since I developed a hearing disability, had difficulty communicating, and spent most of my time either dreaming, creating, or playing with animals. My mother, <a href="http://www.cardelldancetheater.com/">Silvana Cardell</a> is a choreographer whose dance still serves as my main inspiration for being an artist. I therefore spent most of my childhood in her dance studio or creating art using everything from paint to mud. In 2003 I underwent an operation that recovered my hearing.</p>
        
        <p>The economic collapse of the Argentine economy in 2001 was one of the most influential events in my life. My family shortly moved to Philadelphia, where we currently reside. Immigrating sparked an awareness about the impact political conflict on individuals.  Ever since, I’ve had a strong conviction for social change. At the age of 14 I convinced other students to walk out of class to attend an anti-war protest. I started organizing the following year when I started high school. I organized with Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), fundraised for Coalition for Peace Action, and was the president of my high school’s Gay Straight Alliance.</p>  
        
        <p>The only semester I was not involved with organizing was while I studied abroad at the Prepa UdeM in Monterrey, Mexico. During that semester and the following summer I audited six college-level art courses at the University of Monterrey.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to political organizing, I was extremely passionate about fine art. Thankfully, my conviction for my art and work-ethic paid off when I earned a Full Tuition Merit Scholarship at Tyler School of Art.</p>

        <p>Shortly after starting my undergraduate career at Tyler, I found myself on the Brooklyn Bridge watching hundreds of activists getting arrested. That was the day the Occupy movement went viral. Occupy Wall Street inspired me to travel all over the US and Canada. Unfortunately, I didn’t know nearly as much as I know now about political organizing, so I was quite ineffective. I attended countless protests which failed to change anything. I burned out and quit protesting in order to focus on my art because I was receiving opportunities to exhibit my art, including shows at Philadelphia City Hall, Crane Arts, and The Painted Bride.</p>
        
        <p>Thankfully, I rediscovered my passion for social change during my last year of art school. I generated a series of paintings on glass and drawings about the deaparecidos, a series of 30,000 civilians who disappeared during Argentina’s military dictatorship. The exhibition was generously funded by the Dean’s Grant for Student Research from Tyler School of Art. The exhibition was shown at the Embassy of Argentina, Georgian Court University, Tyler School of Art, and Philadelphia City Hall.</p>

        <p>After graduating from Tyler School of Art, Bernie Sanders inspired my return to political organizing. I knocked on hundreds of doors for the Bernie campaign and cried everyday for the months after he lost. After the primary, I was hired as Civic Engagement Coordinator at the Pennsylvania Immigration and Citizenship Coalition, where I organized volunteers to register 3,500 New Americans to vote and make 10,800 GOTV phone calls. After the election, I worked for another organization where I gave presentations 250 to over 6,000 students about the impact of their food choices.</p>
        
        <p>In 2017, I decided to quit my part-time job to focus on developing a professional arts career. While this was one of the most stressful experiences of my life, it paid off in the end: I published my eBook, Blueprint for Creative Dissent, which was downloaded over 600 times and helped countless activists/organizers become more effective! Tobias Linne was so inspired by my eBook, he invited me to present at the Conference of the European Association for Critical Animal Studies in Lund, Sweden. From there I was invited to give presentations in Austria, Luxembourg, the United States, and the United Kingdom.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h2">Current</h2>
        
        <p>I’m currently a candidate for the Masters in Arts (M.A.) Painting program at Plymouth College of Art, where I am developing my research on creative activism and body of work.</p>
