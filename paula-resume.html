        <h2>Artist &amp; Activist</h2>
        <p>I'm an artist engaged in practice-led research on how art can be used to dismantle cognitive barriers that enable systemic oppression. I apply concepts learned from academic research on political organizing, creative activism and the psychology of oppresive ideologies to my art. I then use my art as a tool start conversations about social justice issues and political organizing.</p>

            <p>Due to my success in the promotion of my art, other artists have hired me to help them improve their promotional techniques and marketing materials. A website is arguably one of the most crucial promotional tools for artists, yet most artists miss this opporunity because they don't actually know web design. Therefore, I launched Web Design for Artists to design gorgeous websites for artists that present their work in a professional manner to help them land new opportunities.</p>
