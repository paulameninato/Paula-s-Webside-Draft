    <h2 class="h2">Promote Your Art Through a Professional Website Without Compromising Your Time in the Studio</h2>
    
    <p>As artists, in addition to creating our work, we have to promote our art if we want to create an arts career. Most of us have a day-job along with our studio practice, so marketing our work can feel overwhelming.</p>
    
    <p>An artist website is one of your most essential promotional tools. Art curators and potential buyers regularly view artist's work online before investing in their work. Unfortunately, countless artists lose opportunities because they lack the technical resources to exhibit their work online in a professional manner.</p>

    <p>Designing my first website was incredibly frustrating. I taught myself web design by experimenting until the website functioned how I needed it to.  The whole process was quite stressful and gave me multiple migraines.</p>
</section> 

<section class="section">
    <p>Thankfully, my hard work paid off. A colleague offered me the opportunity to curate monthly exhibitions at the East End Salon after showing them my portfolio via my website. This opportunity helped me promote my work in the heart of the arts district of Philadelphia. From East End, I was able to network and earn incredible opportunities to further my arts career.</p>

    <p>Before graduating from university, I was offered solo shows at The Embassy of Argentina in Washington, DC, The National Real Estate Gallery, Tyler School of Art, and Georgian Court University! </p>

    <p>After graduating from Tyler School of Art, I focused on both creating and promoting my artwork.</p>

    <p>In 2017 I published my eBook, <i>Blueprint for Creative Dissent</i>, which was downloaded 673 times, with 156 of these downloads coming from my website! One of these readers loved my eBook so much he flew me to Sweden to give a presentation at his academic conference. From there I was invited to give presentations in Austria, Luxembourg, the United States, and the United Kingdom.</p>

    <p>Not only do I have experience promoting my art, I have curated exhibitions in the School District of Philadelphia and Philadelphia City Hall. As someone that has experience selecting artists for exhibitions, I know exactly how to design your website to increase your chances of getting your next solo show or residency!</p>

    <p>I’ve also fundraised thousands of dollars by selling artwork. During a group show at Tattooed Mom’s, Mahika Gupta, Rachel Black, and myself partnered to fundraise over $3,000 for The Humane League. I’ve also participated in two fundraisers with Students for Haiti at East End Salon, during both of which we raised over $1,000. Due to my experience selling artwork, I feel confident in my ability to create websites that are likely to convert to sales for artists.</p>
</section> 
    
<section class="section" class="block">
    <h2 class="h2"> That's why I'm the ideal person to design your website. Because I have experience landing opportunities in the arts and can apply that knowledge to your website.</h2>
    
    <p>I want you to take your art career to the next level. The main reason I launched <i>Web Design for Artists</i> is that I'm tired of seing amazing artists not get the recognition they deserve.</p>
        
    <p>I want you to land amazing opportunities through your website, but I don’t want you to get a headache trying to design it yourself. By hiring me, you will keep your sanity by knowing that your website will work. </p>
</section> 

<section>
<aside>        
<p>Now I want to take some time to discuss one of the most important concepts I’ve learned in my arts career:</p>

    <aside class="quote">
        <blockquote>
            <em id="pressfield">“How would you behave if you were the best in the world at what you do?”</em>
            <p><cite>-Steven Pressfield</cite></p>
        </blockquote>
    </aside>

    <p>Let’s think about that quote for a minute: <strong>if you were the best artist in the world, how would you approach promoting your art?</strong> Would you try to design a website yourself despite having no web design experience? Or would you hire a professional to ensure your website performs well?</p>
</aside>
</section> 
    
    <h2 class="h2 client">What My Client Had to Say</h2>

    <p>Because of my success in promoting both my work, other artists have hired me to promote their work and design my website. This is what my client had to say: </p>

    <aside class="quote">
        <blockquote>
            <em id="jeanine">“Paula understood exactly what I wanted done with my website. She worked hard to provide me with the best options for my budget and kept it simple so I could maintain the site when she was gone.  Paula showed me website/social media tools I hadn’t understood before and how to utilize them in the best way for my site. She was flexible with using methods for image sharing that I was comfortable with.   Paula also patiently plugged in all the data that was needed for the site. She was always pleasant, kind, and easy to work with.”</em>
                <p><cite>-Jeanine Leclaire</cite></p>
        </blockquote>
    </aside>

<h2 class="h2">Examples of my work:</h2>

<h2 class="h2">Sooo…. What can I do for you?</h2>
        
<p>Whether you want to sell your designs through e-commerce or become an international resident artist, here is what I can offer:</p>
        
        <!-- // Float lists-->

    <p><strong class="description-title">A professional artist website that includes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>One or multiple portfolio pages</li>
        <li>Resume/CV, biography, and contact pages</li>
        <li>One-on-one consultations with me where you will receive personal feedback on how best to promote your work online</li>

<h2 class="h2 client">My current rates are around £400-600 ($500-764 USD) per website, while most developers are charging £1,600-10,000 ($2,000-12,000 USD) per website!</h2>
    

<p>In the long-term, my rates are more affordable than most DIY website services. For example, Squarespace’s personal website costs £120 ($150 USD) per year. However, a domain name through Bluehost costs just £24 ($30 USD) per year, meaning could save £100 ($127 USD) yearly! If you intend to use the same website for over four years, you would save money by hiring me. </p>
    
    <h2 class="h2">I want to ensure that all of my clients are satisfied with the quality of my work. I am therefore offering free consultations for prospective clients. </h2>
    
    <h2 class="h2">I am only booking 10 clients at the current rates, so you should your consultation now if you want to ensure you don't miss out.</h2>

        <li>If you change your mind before your website is finished, I will offer a partial refund. No refunds will be offered on finished websites. </li>
